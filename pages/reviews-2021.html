		<h2>1. Oona Out of Order by Margarita Montimore [5/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: science fiction, magical realism, coming-of-age, domestic fiction</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>On New Year’s Eve 1982, Oona Lockhart worries about her future: will she pursue an opportunity in London, disappointing her bandmates and leaving her boyfriend behind, or will she continue to play keyboard (not her instrument of choice) and stay with the boyfriend she adores?</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Instead of having to face this decision after the clock strikes midnight, it’s suddenly 2015 and Oona must learn how to live life as a 51-year-old woman. She also learns that she will have to adjust to living each year out of order for the rest of her life. </p>

		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>While I was initially reluctant to read this book (the cover was off-putting to me somehow – too futuristic looking?), I am so glad I started it because I absolutely loved it! It was also somewhat New Year’s Eve themed, so it made for an excellent first book of 2021. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">I found the premise extremely interesting, though I was worried at first that the time-travel aspect wouldn’t be thought out well enough on the author’s part, creating annoying, head-scratching flaws in the logic. However, I think Montimore did a good job of making sure the time-travel made sense, even if it wasn’t all laid out for the reader at the beginning. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">This book honestly made me realize how (relatively) boring many of the books I read are, since I usually read contemporaries that are based in reality. The time-travel made Oona Out of Order exciting the entire way through, while it takes many books awhile to pick up speed. I also appreciated how Montimore struck a good balance with answering questions the reader may have and leaving some mystery. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Many of the critical reviews of this book revolve around Oona’s character. They describe her as too whiny, too unwieldy in her decision making, too immature. 
		<input type=checkbox id="show">
		<label for="show">(Spoilers...)</label>
		<span id="content">First, while Oona is physically different ages, she ages mentally chronologically. E.g. she is mentally 19 when she is physically 51. The book only covers her mental aging from 19 to 25, so it’s understandable that she’s still somewhat immature. Second, criticizing Oona for not heeding the advice of her future/past selves doesn’t make sense – the book makes clear that Oona cannot change her future. </span></p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Overall, this book was a delight to read and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the contemporary genre with a twist! </p>
