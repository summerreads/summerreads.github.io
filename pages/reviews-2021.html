		<h2>5. Memorial by Brian Washington [2/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: contemporary, LGBTQ</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>“Benson and Mike are two young guys who live together in Houston. Mike is a Japanese American chef at a Mexican restaurant and Benson's a Black day care teacher, and they've been together for a few years -- good years -- but now they're not sure why they're still a couple. There's the sex, sure, and the meals Mike cooks for Benson, and, well, they love each other.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		But when Mike finds out his estranged father is dying in Osaka just as his acerbic Japanese mother, Mitsuko, arrives in Texas for a visit, Mike picks up and flies across the world to say goodbye. In Japan he undergoes an extraordinary transformation, discovering the truth about his family and his past. Back home, Mitsuko and Benson are stuck living together as unconventional roommates, an absurd domestic situation that ends up meaning more to each of them than they ever could have predicted. Without Mike's immediate pull, Benson begins to push outwards, realizing he might just know what he wants out of life and have the goods to get it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Both men will change in ways that will either make them stronger together, or fracture everything they've ever known. And just maybe they'll all be okay in the end. Memorial is a funny and profound story about family in all its strange forms, joyful and hard-won vulnerability, becoming who you're supposed to be, and the limits of love.”</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p> I wanted to like this book because it’s pretty different from the books I usually read, but unfortunately it was unpleasant. Reading it felt like stepping into a lazy college guy’s apartment, smelling fast food, and feeling the life getting sucked out of you. It was just a DOWNER – the subject matter and the tone of the writing. The author tried hard to be poignant, but did not make me care about Benson or Mike’s lives. I was relieved when it was over. </p>

		<h2>3. Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert [3.5/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: memoir</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>“Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.”</p>

		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>Hmm this book. I understand why some people hate it and others love it. Elizabeth Gilbert is certainly a gifted writer, but she comes on STRONG. Her personality shines through, and it’s oftentimes quite annoying. Add that on top of the layers of self-indulgence this book has (memoir + search for self + the literal indulgence of the Eat chapter) and it’s enough to push readers over the edge.  </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		My main problem with this book wasn’t Gilbert’s self-centeredness, though. It was the damn boring nature of the book. An entire third about seeking pleasure in Italy through food and language…and then what? I would be interested in reading one chapter about that, not 100 pages. The same problem was present in the Pray section. Only the Love section became engaging because Gilbert introduced some additional characters into the mix. </p>

		<h2>3. Cubed: The Puzzle of Us All by Ernő Rubik [5/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: autobiography, history</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>Ernő Rubik was a child when he first became obsessed with puzzles of all kinds. "Puzzles," he writes, "bring out important qualities in each of us: concentration, curiosity, a sense of play, the eagerness to discover a solution." To Rubik puzzles aren't just games--they're creativity machines. He encourages us to embrace our inner curiosity and find the puzzles that surround us in our everyday lives. "If you are determined, you will solve them," he writes. Rubik's own puzzle, the Cube, went on to be solved by millions worldwide for over forty years, become one of the bestselling toys of all time, and to be featured as a global symbol of intelligence and ingenuity.
		<p style="text-indent:25px">In Cubed, Rubik covers more than just his journey to inventing his eponymous cube. He makes a case for always being an amateur--something he has always considered himself to be. He discusses the inevitability of problems during any act of invention. He reveals what it was like to experience the astonishing worldwide success of an object he made purely for his own play. And he offers what he thinks it means to be a true creator (hint: anyone can do it). Steeped in the wisdom and also the humility of a born inventor, Cubed offers a unique look at the imperfect science of creation</p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>This book was just delightful. Because of the cultural associations of the Rubik’s Cube, I hoped that Rubik would be an eccentric genius and he did not disappoint. I certainly didn’t understand everything he discussed in the book, but that added to the charm. I found myself giggling out loud as he described mixing and trying to solve the Cube for the first time. I thought there was a good mix of personal history / Cube history / Cube philosophizing. Thoroughly enjoyed!</p>

		<a style="display:table-cell;vertical-align:top;"><img src="../images/books/C2.jpg" alt="One Day in December " style="float:left;width:240px;height:360px;padding:0px 20px 10px 0px"></a>
		
		<h2>2. One Day in December by Josie Silver [3.5/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: contemporary, romance</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>Two people. Ten chances. One unforgettable love story. </p>
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Laurie is pretty sure love at first sight doesn't exist anywhere but the movies. But then, through a misted-up bus window one snowy December day, she sees a man who she knows instantly is the one. Their eyes meet, there's a moment of pure magic... and then her bus drives away.</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Certain they're fated to find each other again, Laurie spends a year scanning every bus stop and cafe in London for him. But she doesn't find him, not when it matters anyway. Instead they "reunite" at a Christmas party, when her best friend Sarah giddily introduces her new boyfriend to Laurie. It's Jack, the man from the bus. It would be.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">What follows for Laurie, Sarah and Jack is ten years of friendship, heartbreak, missed opportunities, roads not taken, and destinies reconsidered. One Day in December is a joyous, heartwarming and immensely moving love story to escape into and a reminder that fate takes inexplicable turns along the route to happiness</p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>One Day in December was…fine, maybe even good. I enjoyed how Silver took the time to really build up the relationships in the book, but she couldn’t strike a balance between slow development of characters and remaining interesting. I think this book was about 100 pages too long. 
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Overall, I did enjoy Laurie and Jack’s chaotic relationship, as I love reading about people making poor decisions. That relationship didn’t tug my heartstrings as much as the Laurie/Sarah relationship, though. Silver wrote about female friendship beautifully.

		<h2>1. Oona Out of Order by Margarita Montimore [5/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: science fiction, magical realism, coming-of-age, domestic fiction</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>On New Year’s Eve 1982, Oona Lockhart worries about her future: will she pursue an opportunity in London, disappointing her bandmates and leaving her boyfriend behind, or will she continue to play keyboard (not her instrument of choice) and stay with the boyfriend she adores?</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Instead of having to face this decision after the clock strikes midnight, it’s suddenly 2015 and Oona must learn how to live life as a 51-year-old woman. She also learns that she will have to adjust to living each year out of order for the rest of her life. </p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>While I was initially reluctant to read this book (the cover was off-putting to me somehow – too futuristic looking?), I am so glad I started it because I absolutely loved it! It was also somewhat New Year’s Eve themed, so it made for an excellent first book of 2021. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">I found the premise extremely interesting, though I was worried at first that the time-travel aspect wouldn’t be thought out well enough on the author’s part, creating annoying, head-scratching flaws in the logic. However, I think Montimore did a good job of making sure the time-travel made sense, even if it wasn’t all laid out for the reader at the beginning. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">This book honestly made me realize how (relatively) boring many of the books I read are, since I usually read contemporaries that are based in reality. The time-travel made Oona Out of Order exciting the entire way through, while it takes many books awhile to pick up speed. I also appreciated how Montimore struck a good balance with answering questions the reader may have and leaving some mystery. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Many of the critical reviews of this book revolve around Oona’s character. They describe her as too whiny, too unwieldy in her decision making, too immature. 
		<input type=checkbox id="show">
		<label for="show">(Spoilers...)</label>
		<span id="content">First, while Oona is physically different ages, she ages mentally chronologically. E.g. she is mentally 19 when she is physically 51. The book only covers her mental aging from 19 to 25, so it’s understandable that she’s still somewhat immature. Second, criticizing Oona for not heeding the advice of her future/past selves doesn’t make sense – the book makes clear that Oona cannot change her future. </span></p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Overall, this book was a delight to read and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the contemporary genre with a twist! </p>
