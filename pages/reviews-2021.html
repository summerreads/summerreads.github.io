		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>“Poppy and Alex. Alex and Poppy. They have nothing in common. She’s a wild child; he wears khakis. She has insatiable wanderlust; he prefers to stay home with a book. And somehow, ever since a fateful car share home from college many years ago, they are the very best of friends. For most of the year they live far apart—she’s in New York City, and he’s in their small hometown—but every summer, for a decade, they have taken one glorious week of vacation together.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">Until two years ago, when they ruined everything. They haven’t spoken since.</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Poppy has everything she should want, but she’s stuck in a rut. When someone asks when she was last truly happy, she knows, without a doubt, it was on that ill-fated, final trip with Alex. And so, she decides to convince her best friend to take one more vacation together—lay everything on the table, make it all right. Miraculously, he agrees.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">Now she has a week to fix everything. If only she can get around the one big truth that has always stood quietly in the middle of their seemingly perfect relationship. What could possibly go wrong?”</p>

		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>Emily Henry writes ACTUALLY GOOD contemporary romances! So much in this genre is just pleasant fluff, but her books have depth. The way she develops characters is excellent. Touching and entertaining the whole way through.</p>

		<h2>11. Nine Nasty Words: English in the Gutter: Then, Now, and Forever by John McWhorter [4/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: linguistics   </h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>“One of the preeminent linguists of our time examines the realms of language that are considered shocking and taboo in order to understand what imbues curse words with such power--and why we love them so much.</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Profanity has always been a deliciously vibrant part of our lexicon, an integral part of being human. In fact, our ability to curse comes from a different part of the brain than other parts of speech--the urgency with which we say "f&*k!" is instead related to the instinct that tells us to flee from danger.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">Language evolves with time, and so does what we consider profane or unspeakable. Nine Nasty Words is a rollicking examination of profanity, explored from every angle: historical, sociological, political, linguistic. In a particularly coarse moment, when the public discourse is shaped in part by once-shocking words, nothing could be timelier.”</p>


		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>I enjoy most things that come out of John McWhorter’s brain and this book is no exception. McWhorter discusses the evolution of profanity, from the most profane words being about religion, to the body, to slurs. This was a great audiobook, as McWhorter reads it himself and is a very entertaining reader!</p> 

		<p style="text-indent:25px">While I loved it overall, this doesn’t get five stars because 1. It was just a tiny bit too boring in some sections, and 2. There were some cases where I thought he really missed the mark. Main example: When discussing Trump’s infamous “Grab her by the pussy” quote, he argues that the use of the word “pussy” is primarily what offended everyone. I think not… </p>

		<h2>10. Detransition, Baby by Torrey Peters [5/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: romance, holiday, contemporary  </h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>“Reese almost had it all: a loving relationship with Amy, an apartment in New York City, a job she didn't hate. She had scraped together what previous generations of trans women could only dream of: a life of mundane, bourgeois comforts. The only thing missing was a child. But then her girlfriend, Amy, detransitioned and became Ames, and everything fell apart. Now Reese is caught in a self-destructive pattern: avoiding her loneliness by sleeping with married men.</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Ames isn't happy either. He thought detransitioning to live as a man would make life easier, but that decision cost him his relationship with Reese—and losing her meant losing his only family. Even though their romance is over, he longs to find a way back to her. When Ames's boss and lover, Katrina, reveals that she's pregnant with his baby—and that she's not sure whether she wants to keep it—Ames wonders if this is the chance he's been waiting for. Could the three of them form some kind of unconventional family—and raise the baby together?</p>
	
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		This provocative debut is about what happens at the emotional, messy, vulnerable corners of womanhood that platitudes and good intentions can't reach. Torrey Peters brilliantly and fearlessly navigates the most dangerous taboos around gender, sex, and relationships, gifting us a thrillingly original, witty, and deeply moving novel.”</p>


		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>I really loved this book! It was fascinating to be so immersed in trans culture -- I had never read anything even remotely similar before. This was also a very heartbreaking book as the author beautifully told the story of the events leading up to Ames’s detransition. The climax of the book is one of the best-written scenes I’ve ever read. </p> 
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Since I get most of my books from the library, I buy my favorites at the end of the year. I suspect this will be one I buy!</p>

		<h2>9. In A Holidaze by Christina Lauren [3/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: romance, holiday, contemporary  </h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>“It’s the most wonderful time of the year…but not for Maelyn Jones. She’s living with her parents, hates her going-nowhere job, and has just made a romantic error of epic proportions.</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">But perhaps worst of all, this is the last Christmas Mae will be at her favorite place in the world—the snowy Utah cabin where she and her family have spent every holiday since she was born, along with two other beloved families. Mentally melting down as she drives away from the cabin for the final time, Mae throws out what she thinks is a simple plea to the universe: Please. Show me what will make me happy.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">The next thing she knows, tires screech and metal collides, everything goes black. But when Mae gasps awake…she’s on an airplane bound for Utah, where she begins the same holiday all over again. With one hilarious disaster after another sending her back to the plane, Mae must figure out how to break free of the strange time loop—and finally get her true love under the mistletoe.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">Jam-packed with yuletide cheer, an unforgettable cast of characters, and Christina Lauren’s trademark “downright hilarious” (Helen Hoang, author of The Bride Test) hijinks, this swoon-worthy romantic read will make you believe in the power of wishes and the magic of the holidays.”</p>


		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>This one was pleasant but bizarre. The time travel was unexplained, felt very out of place, and really only affected the first third of the book. I understand wanting to throw in a supernatural component to spice up a plot, but this book required a bit too much suspension of disbelief to be good. Other than that, it was certainly a cozy Christmas read. </p>

		<h2>8. Daisy Jones and The Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid  [5/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: historical fiction </h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>“A gripping novel about the whirlwind rise of an iconic 1970s rock group and their beautiful lead singer, revealing the mystery behind their infamous break up.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Everyone knows Daisy Jones & The Six, but nobody knows the real reason why they split at the absolute height of their popularity…until now.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go-Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock and roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Another band getting noticed is The Six, led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.”</p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>I loved this one, and having also loved The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, I’m officially a Taylor Jenkins Reid fan! She has a way of pulling the reader in immediately. With Evelyn Hugo, it was through quickly establishing a mystery, but with this one, it was just because the writing was good. I tried to put my finger on what exactly makes it so good, but I can’t. It’s just good! </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		This one was different in that it was written entirely as interview transcripts, which didn’t bother me but also didn’t add much to the story. I suppose it made sense, as the book isn’t very plot-driven, but very character-driven. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Saying too much would spoil it, but I loved the Camila character and the Camila/Billy relationship. I’m happy to hear this book will be a series on Amazon!

		<h2>7. Everything is Spiritual by Rob Bell [3.5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: memoir, religion </h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		
		<p>I’ve had a sense since I was young that there’s more going on here, that the world is not a cold, dead place, that it’s alive in some compelling and mysterious way.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		This book is about that sense. I’ve tried to listen to it, and follow it, and trust it. It’s been devastating at times, intoxicating at others, heartbreaking and maddening and euphoric――how do you make sense of this experience we’re having here on this ball of rock hurtling through space at 67,000 miles an hour?</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		There are big questions: Everything is made of particles and atoms, and the universe has been expanding for thirteen billion years?</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		And then there are those other questions, about the people and places and
		events that have shaped us.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		HOWEVER MASSIVE AND COSMIC IT ALL IS, IT’S ALSO REALLY, REALLY PERSONAL. AND SPIRITUAL. THAT’S THE WORD FOR IT.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		That’s the sense I’ve been following for a while now――this awareness that there’s something bigger happening in the depth and complexity and struggle of life, something that connects us all, reminding us that it all matters and it’s all headed somewhere.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Part memoir, part confession, part extended riff on the endlessly evolving nature of reality, Everything Is Spiritual is an invitation to see what you’ve been a part of this whole time.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p> Hmm now this book. I loved the first half, the more memoir-style half, where he discussed his experiences building what became a mega-church and his overall take on Christianity. I appreciate Bell’s insistence that Christianity should be about acting Christ-like, not being shamed and feared into acting a certain way.</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		The second half of the book lost me a bit. He kept making parallels between super complex science like quantum physics and the nature of being human, which I found very weak. I was also bothered by the inherently arrogant nature of the book: an enlightened one letting the unenlightened ones in on “who we are and what we’re doing here.” His frequent use of the Enter key and bold type only made this worse. I can’t help but compare this work to Reason for Hope by Jane Goodall, which is about similar themes but written from a beautifully humble perspective.  </p>

		<h2>6. The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang  [1/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: contemporary, romance</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p> This book was wild in a bad way. Stella’s autism was a little more convincing in the beginning of the book, but as soon as she meets Michael, it’s as if she’s magically no longer autistic. Moreover, the “love at first sight” trope was annoyingly strong in this. Obviously it’s possible to have immense lust for someone immediately, but the writing on this subject felt so cliché and boring. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		The sex scenes were frequent and graphic. This isn’t inherently a problem, but the author used terms like “her sex” to refer to a vagina, making it feel like I was reading fan fic. Cringe. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Overall, this book was a little uncomfortable, boring, and very predictable. I’m baffled by all the positive reviews it receives online. </p>

		<h2>5. Memorial by Brian Washington [2/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: contemporary, LGBTQ</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>“Benson and Mike are two young guys who live together in Houston. Mike is a Japanese American chef at a Mexican restaurant and Benson's a Black day care teacher, and they've been together for a few years -- good years -- but now they're not sure why they're still a couple. There's the sex, sure, and the meals Mike cooks for Benson, and, well, they love each other.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		But when Mike finds out his estranged father is dying in Osaka just as his acerbic Japanese mother, Mitsuko, arrives in Texas for a visit, Mike picks up and flies across the world to say goodbye. In Japan he undergoes an extraordinary transformation, discovering the truth about his family and his past. Back home, Mitsuko and Benson are stuck living together as unconventional roommates, an absurd domestic situation that ends up meaning more to each of them than they ever could have predicted. Without Mike's immediate pull, Benson begins to push outwards, realizing he might just know what he wants out of life and have the goods to get it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		Both men will change in ways that will either make them stronger together, or fracture everything they've ever known. And just maybe they'll all be okay in the end. Memorial is a funny and profound story about family in all its strange forms, joyful and hard-won vulnerability, becoming who you're supposed to be, and the limits of love.”</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p> I wanted to like this book because it’s pretty different from the books I usually read, but unfortunately it was unpleasant. Reading it felt like stepping into a lazy college guy’s apartment, smelling fast food, and feeling the life getting sucked out of you. It was just a DOWNER – the subject matter and the tone of the writing. The author tried hard to be poignant, but did not make me care about Benson or Mike’s lives. I was relieved when it was over. </p>

		<p>“Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.”</p>

		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>Hmm this book. I understand why some people hate it and others love it. Elizabeth Gilbert is certainly a gifted writer, but she comes on STRONG. Her personality shines through, and it’s oftentimes quite annoying. Add that on top of the layers of self-indulgence this book has (memoir + search for self + the literal indulgence of the Eat chapter) and it’s enough to push readers over the edge.  </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">
		My main problem with this book wasn’t Gilbert’s self-centeredness, though. It was the damn boring nature of the book. An entire third about seeking pleasure in Italy through food and language…and then what? I would be interested in reading one chapter about that, not 100 pages. The same problem was present in the Pray section. Only the Love section became engaging because Gilbert introduced some additional characters into the mix. </p>

		<h2>3. Cubed: The Puzzle of Us All by Ernő Rubik [5/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: autobiography, history</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>Ernő Rubik was a child when he first became obsessed with puzzles of all kinds. "Puzzles," he writes, "bring out important qualities in each of us: concentration, curiosity, a sense of play, the eagerness to discover a solution." To Rubik puzzles aren't just games--they're creativity machines. He encourages us to embrace our inner curiosity and find the puzzles that surround us in our everyday lives. "If you are determined, you will solve them," he writes. Rubik's own puzzle, the Cube, went on to be solved by millions worldwide for over forty years, become one of the bestselling toys of all time, and to be featured as a global symbol of intelligence and ingenuity.
		<p style="text-indent:25px">In Cubed, Rubik covers more than just his journey to inventing his eponymous cube. He makes a case for always being an amateur--something he has always considered himself to be. He discusses the inevitability of problems during any act of invention. He reveals what it was like to experience the astonishing worldwide success of an object he made purely for his own play. And he offers what he thinks it means to be a true creator (hint: anyone can do it). Steeped in the wisdom and also the humility of a born inventor, Cubed offers a unique look at the imperfect science of creation</p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>This book was just delightful. Because of the cultural associations of the Rubik’s Cube, I hoped that Rubik would be an eccentric genius and he did not disappoint. I certainly didn’t understand everything he discussed in the book, but that added to the charm. I found myself giggling out loud as he described mixing and trying to solve the Cube for the first time. I thought there was a good mix of personal history / Cube history / Cube philosophizing. Thoroughly enjoyed!</p>

		<h2>2. One Day in December by Josie Silver [3.5/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: contemporary, romance</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>Two people. Ten chances. One unforgettable love story. </p>
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Laurie is pretty sure love at first sight doesn't exist anywhere but the movies. But then, through a misted-up bus window one snowy December day, she sees a man who she knows instantly is the one. Their eyes meet, there's a moment of pure magic... and then her bus drives away.</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Certain they're fated to find each other again, Laurie spends a year scanning every bus stop and cafe in London for him. But she doesn't find him, not when it matters anyway. Instead they "reunite" at a Christmas party, when her best friend Sarah giddily introduces her new boyfriend to Laurie. It's Jack, the man from the bus. It would be.</p>

		<p style="text-indent:25px">What follows for Laurie, Sarah and Jack is ten years of friendship, heartbreak, missed opportunities, roads not taken, and destinies reconsidered. One Day in December is a joyous, heartwarming and immensely moving love story to escape into and a reminder that fate takes inexplicable turns along the route to happiness</p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>One Day in December was…fine, maybe even good. I enjoyed how Silver took the time to really build up the relationships in the book, but she couldn’t strike a balance between slow development of characters and remaining interesting. I think this book was about 100 pages too long. 
		
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Overall, I did enjoy Laurie and Jack’s chaotic relationship, as I love reading about people making poor decisions. That relationship didn’t tug my heartstrings as much as the Laurie/Sarah relationship, though. Silver wrote about female friendship beautifully.

		<h2>1. Oona Out of Order by Margarita Montimore [5/5 stars]</h2>
		<h3>Genres: science fiction, magical realism, coming-of-age, domestic fiction</h3>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Premise:</b></p>
		<p>On New Year’s Eve 1982, Oona Lockhart worries about her future: will she pursue an opportunity in London, disappointing her bandmates and leaving her boyfriend behind, or will she continue to play keyboard (not her instrument of choice) and stay with the boyfriend she adores?</p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Instead of having to face this decision after the clock strikes midnight, it’s suddenly 2015 and Oona must learn how to live life as a 51-year-old woman. She also learns that she will have to adjust to living each year out of order for the rest of her life. </p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><b>Review:</b></p> 
		<p>While I was initially reluctant to read this book (the cover was off-putting to me somehow – too futuristic looking?), I am so glad I started it because I absolutely loved it! It was also somewhat New Year’s Eve themed, so it made for an excellent first book of 2021. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">I found the premise extremely interesting, though I was worried at first that the time-travel aspect wouldn’t be thought out well enough on the author’s part, creating annoying, head-scratching flaws in the logic. However, I think Montimore did a good job of making sure the time-travel made sense, even if it wasn’t all laid out for the reader at the beginning. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">This book honestly made me realize how (relatively) boring many of the books I read are, since I usually read contemporaries that are based in reality. The time-travel made Oona Out of Order exciting the entire way through, while it takes many books awhile to pick up speed. I also appreciated how Montimore struck a good balance with answering questions the reader may have and leaving some mystery. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Many of the critical reviews of this book revolve around Oona’s character. They describe her as too whiny, too unwieldy in her decision making, too immature. 
		<input type=checkbox id="show">
		<label for="show">(Spoilers...)</label>
		<span id="content">First, while Oona is physically different ages, she ages mentally chronologically. E.g. she is mentally 19 when she is physically 51. The book only covers her mental aging from 19 to 25, so it’s understandable that she’s still somewhat immature. Second, criticizing Oona for not heeding the advice of her future/past selves doesn’t make sense – the book makes clear that Oona cannot change her future. </span></p>
		<p style="text-indent:25px">Overall, this book was a delight to read and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the contemporary genre with a twist! </p>
